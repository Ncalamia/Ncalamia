## Projects 
---
## [Portfolio](https://nikkicalamia.herokuapp.com/)
> #### My professional portfolio

#### Technologies Used:
* Built with **React** and **Next.js** which provides an easy way to create dynamic pages and handle routing throughout the application.  
* Implemented **Tailwind CSS** for more control over styling as well as exceptional responsiveness on mobile devices, desktop and everything in between.

## [Co-Operate](https://co-operate-frontend.herokuapp.com/)
> #### A Full-Stack CRUD application designed to allow organizations to communicate more effectively, while also increasing employee participation. The events page is accessible by employees and allows them to sign up to bring something for each event. In addition, the admin page allows for the admin (incharge of planning each event) to perform full CRUD functionality on each event (add, delete or edit an event). The updates page will serve as a platform for morale boosting announcements (employee birthdays, milestones in years of service, etc).

#### Technologies Used:
* Built with **React** and **React router**, this applications frontend navigates to and from each page with ease.
* Backend built with **Python**, **PostgreSQL** and **Django REST framework** streamlines multiple models with the use of foreign keys for the implementation of user auth as well as CRUD functionality for the user and admin.


## [Essentials.](https://homegoods-store.herokuapp.com/)
> #### A Full-Stack CRUD application for those who love online shopping. Built as a collaboration with 2 other devs: this site is not only visually pleasing, but also is functionally sound. Each user can create an account, log in and then proceed to add, edit, or delete home good products from the site.

#### Technologies Used:
* Backend built with **Python**, **PostgreSQL** and **Django REST framework** simplified linking data and applying user authentication.
* Built with **React** and **MaterialUI** allowed for the team to build a stylish and responsive site in less than a week.


## [America's Gun Problem](https://americas-gun-problem.herokuapp.com/)
> #### America's Gun Problem is a Full-Stack MERN application created by two like-minded software devs who want to make a change. With mass shootings on the rise in America in recent years, we wanted to bring awareness to the situation. This app includes: a mass shootings in America (MSA) page to bring awareness on the gravity of the issue, a list of Senators with search capabilities so constituents can reach out and advocate for stricter gun laws in their state, and a mental health forum with full CRUD functionality, allowing users to add, edit and delete posts.
#### Technologies Used: 
* Frontend build in **React** with exemplary responsiveness.
* Built with **Express** server and **MongoDB** allowed for seemless CRUD functionality throughout the database and straightforward organization with multiple models. 


## [Accomplished.](https://accomplished-to-do-app.herokuapp.com/to-do)
> #### Accomplished. is a Full-Stack CRUD application that breaks down tasks into smaller ones to help visualize the task at hand as more approachable. This helps reduce procrastination and gives a sense of accomplishment when checking something off of the list. The affirmation generator provides motivation every time you open the app. Use this app to not only accomplish daily tasks around the house, but also large projects too!
#### Technologies Used:
* Server-side rendering app using **EJS** and **Express** server with **MongoDB** allows for easy backend maintance in the future. 
* Ongoing developement: refactoring data to allow for user authentication and multiple models.
